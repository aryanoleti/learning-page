          "Diversification is not free of trade-offs. Spread far enough and your result converges on the market's average — big winners get diluted along with the losers.",

      question: "Why can diversification reduce risk without reducing expected return?",
      options: [
      "Because a larger number of companies earns more",
      "Because disasters cancel out; the average holds",
      "Because spreading money eliminates market falls",
      "Because diversified portfolios avoid losses",

      answer: 1,
      explain:
        "You keep the average return of what you hold, but the unpredictable company-specific swings partly offset each other. That is the rare free improvement in investing.",
